Lab 3 – Decisions

Complete the following code to test whether two circles, each having a user-defined radius and a fixed center point lying along the same horizontal line, are disjoint, overlapping, or mutually contained. Consider how you would do it manually first.

“`javaimport java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleOverlap{public static void main(String[] args){Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.print(“Input the radius of the first circle: “);double radius1 = in.nextDouble();double xcenter1 = 0;double ycenter1 = 0;System.out.print(“Input the radius of the second circle: “);double radius2 = in.nextDouble();double xcenter2 = 40;double ycenter2 = 0;// Your work goes here}}“`
